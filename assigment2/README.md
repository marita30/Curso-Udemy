1. create an input field (in App component) with a change listener which outputs the length of the entered text below it(e.g in a pharagraph).

2. Create a new component(=>ValidationComponent) which receives the text length as a prop.

3. Inside the validationComponent, either output "Text long enough" depending on the text length (e.g. take 5 as a minimun length).

4. Create another component (=> CharComponent) and style it as an inline box(=> display: inline-block, padding: 16px, text-align: center, margin: 16px, border: 1px solid.

5. Render a list of CharComponent where each CharComponent receives a different letter of the entered text(in the initial input fiel) as a prop.

6. When you click a CharComponent, it should be removed from the entered text.
